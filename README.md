# 🗣️ Chatty Lip Sync – When AI Talks, and You Believe It

**An AI-powered, real-time lip-syncing digital human that listens, understands, and speaks back naturally.**  
Every blink, every mouth movement — perfectly in sync.

## ✨ Overview
**Chatty Lip Sync** isn’t just a voice generator — it’s a full **AI conversation engine** that merges speech recognition, intelligent responses, natural speech synthesis, and perfect lip movements into one immersive experience.  

Imagine chatting with a digital human who not only talks but **looks you in the eye, reacts with emotion, and syncs every lip movement to their words**.  
It’s **conversation made human**.  

This backend was developed as part of my **internship project**, focusing on building robust server-side logic, integrating AI APIs, and enabling seamless real-time communication between the AI brain and the avatar.

## 🔮 How It Works

1. **🎙️ You Speak or Type**  
   - Speak naturally or type your question.  
   - Voice input is instantly transcribed using **Whisper AI**.

2. **🧠 AI Thinks & Responds**  
   - Transcribed text is sent to **GPT**, generating a smart, human-like reply.  
   - No pre-written scripts — every answer is unique.

3. **🎧 From Text to Real Voice**  
   - The reply text is converted into ultra-realistic speech with **ElevenLabs**.

4. **👄 Lip Movements that Match Every Word**  
   - Speech audio is analyzed with **Rhubarb Lip Sync** to determine exact mouth shapes (visemes) for every sound.

5. **🧍 Your Digital Human Comes Alive**  
   - Voice + lip-sync data are merged to animate your **digital avatar** in real time.
